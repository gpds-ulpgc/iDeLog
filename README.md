# iDeLog
Iterative Dual Spatial and Kinematic Extraction of Sigma-Lognormal Parameters 
This software is after the paper:
Miguel A. Ferrer, Moises Diaz, Cristina Carmona-Duarte, RÃ©jean Plamondon, "iDeLog: Iterative Dual Spatial and Kinematic Extraction of Sigma-Lognormal Parameter", in IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, ISSN: 0162-8828, vol. 42, no. 1, pp 114-125, 1 Jan 2020, doi: 10.1109/TPAMI.2018.2879312.
It is an alternative to scriptstudio software. Please, go over the paper for more details.
It has been developed as a toolbox in Matlab,
The file pruebaiDeLog.m show an example of how to use the toolbox. Please read the help of iDeLog to know the meaning of each input/output parameter.
The file c-001-01.mat is a test signature.
We also provide the function PruebaReconstruirScriptStudioFile.m which read a file .ana (from scriptstudio) and reconstruct the signature
To install the tollbox I Matlab:
1.	Extract the .p files from LognormalsDecomposition.rar file
2.	Save the .p files in LognormalsDecomposition folder
3.	Add LognormalsDecomposition folder to Matlab path
4.	Run Prueba iDeLog
